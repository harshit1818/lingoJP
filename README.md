**LingoJP** - My personal Japanese→English translation tool.

Built this for myself and friends who read Japanese content regularly. No fuss, just works.

## What it does:
- **Sees Japanese text** → **Translates to English automatically**
- **No language selection needed** → Just browse Japanese sites
- **One-click page translation** → Perfect for news, blogs, documentation
- **Private** → No data sent anywhere

*Modified from the open-source Linguist project.*

# Quick Install

## For Chrome:
1. Download [LingoJP-Chrome-v1.0.0.zip](https://github.com/harshit1818/lingoJP/releases)
2. Extract the ZIP 
3. Chrome → `chrome://extensions/` → Enable "Developer mode" → "Load unpacked" → Select folder
4. Done! Visit any Japanese site.

## Firefox:
Same process but use `about:debugging` → "Load Temporary Add-on"

# Usage
Just visit Japanese websites. It translates automatically.
